# TYPO3 Smooth Reelworx\RxSmoothmigration7\Domain\Interfaces\Migration Reelworx\RxSmoothmigration7\Domain\Model\IssueLocation\Extension

This extension is targeted to all TYPO3 CMS 6.2 LTS users, which want to have a smooth upgrade to CMS 7.
The extension will be updated with every TYPO3 CMS 7.x release, so it might be handy as well, when updating to the next sprint release of version 7.

All tasks are now executed from the command line.

Please refer to the extension's documentation available on http://docs.typo3.org/ for more information on installation and usage.

The extension is based on https://github.com/nxpthx/typo3-upgradereport, initially written for upgrading from TYPO3 4.5 to TYPO3 CMS 6.2.
